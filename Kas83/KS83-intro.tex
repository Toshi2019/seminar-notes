\chapter{Introduction}

This book is grew out from a course that 
Masaki Kashiwara gave at the ``Universit\'e Paris-Nord'' 
during the first term of the academic year 1976--77. 
Teresa Monterio Fernandes worked out lecture notes for 
this course, which were preprinted in 1979 by Paris-Nord 
under the title ``Syst\`ems d'\'equations 
microdiff\'erentielles'' and distributed to a happy few.
