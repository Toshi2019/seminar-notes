\chapter*{Preface}
In the spring of 1963 I suggested to 
Grothendieck the possibility of my running a seminar 
at Harvard on his theory of duality for coherent sheaves 
--- a theory which had been hinted at in his talk 
to the S\'eminaire Bourbaki in 1957 [8],
and in his talk to the International Congress of Mathematicians
in 1958 [9], but had never been developed systematically. 
He agreed, saying that 
he would provide an outline of the material,
if I would fill in the details and write up lecture notes 
of the seminar. 
During the summer of 1963, he wrote a series
of ``pr\'enotes'' [10] 
which were to be the basis for the seminar.

I quote from the preface of the pr\'enotes:
``Les presentes notes donnent 
une esquisse assez detaillee d'une theorie cohomologique 
de la dualite des Modules coherents sur les preschemas. 
Les idees principales de la theorie m'etaient connues des 1959, 
mais Ie manque de fondements
