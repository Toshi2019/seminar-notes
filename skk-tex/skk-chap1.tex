\chapter{Theory of Microfunctions}

\section{Construction of the sheaf of microfunctions}

\subsection{Hyperfunctions}

Let $M$ be an $n$-dimentional real analytic manifold 
and $X$ be a complex neifgborhood of $M$. 




\subsection{Real monoidal transformation and real comonoidal transformation}

Now consider the following situation, although we apply it 
to a special case in this section.




\subsection{Definition of microfunctions}

Now we will come back to the original situation. 




\subsection{Sheaves on sphere bundle and on cosphere bundle}

We consider the following situation.



\subsection{Fundamental diagram on $\mathscr{C}$}

We will apply the arguements in the preceding section 
to a special case.

\section{Several oprations on hyperfunctions and microfunctions}
