\begin{rem}
    Let $X$ be a complex manifold. We denote by $\DD_X$ (resp. $\fin{\DD}_X$) 
    the sheaf of differential operators on $X$ (resp. differential 
    operators of finite order on $X$). 
    $\PP_X$ (resp. $\fin{\PP}_X$) is a $\pi^{-1}\DD_X$-Algebra 
    (resp. $\pi^{-1}\fin{\DD}_X$-Algebra).
