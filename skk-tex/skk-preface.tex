\chapter*{Preface for Part II}

This is the last of two parts of the Proceedings of
the conference on Hyperfunctions and Pseudo-Differential 
Equations held at Katata on October 12--14, 1971. 

This part consists of a paper by 
M. Sato, T. Kawai and M. Kashiwara which is an enlarged 
version of four lectures by them delivered at the conference.

We received the final manuscript in June, 1971 but have
postponed the publication because the authors had the intention
of adding an introduction to the paper. 
Since we do not think it appropriate to wait for it forever, 
we have decided to publish this part in the present form. 

In place of the introduction, we advise the reader to read 
the lectures by the authors at different occasions, 
the Nice Congress, 1970, the A. M. S. Symposium on 
Partial Differential Equations at Berkeley, 1971, 
and the Colloque C. N. R. S. Equations aux 
D\'eriv\'ees Partielles Lin\'eaires at Orsay, 1972. 

We thank Miss C. Sagawa for typing and Mr.\ T. Miwa and 
Mr.\ T.\ Oshima for proof-reading.
